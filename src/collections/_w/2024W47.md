My partner (AM) is **studying for the GRE** and her weak spot is the math section. I was confident that I could help her since I've always been good at math and had lots of experience in college. Statistics was tough for me. It isn't my favorite topic but I expected to remember more than I did. I was re-learning right alongside her. The geometry section was much better thoughâ€”studying how fluids move through pipes for four years really paid off there. It's been fun brushing up on all the school math that I haven't touched in two years.

When I was in Morocco, I didn't really take care of my body. It was a daily emotional and spiritual challenge and my physical wellbeing usually wasn't a priority. I also don't really like exercising just to exercise. Now that I'm back and have lots of time on my hands, I can start to prioritize it again. I got a **membership at the rec center** here in town which gives me access to the gym and open rec games that anyone can join.

The first order of business was to **try pickleball.** AM and I showed up at noon on a Tuesday and everyone there was retired and at least 25 years older us. They have a little community there and everyone was so kind to us. They showed us how to queue for a game, how to play, then split the teams up so it would be more fair. We'll definitely be going back after Thanksgiving.

I **ran for the first time in years** on the day after when there wasn't any pickleball. I jumped on the treadmill and surprised myself by running a mile and a half in a little under 20 minutes. Not bad after being essentially stagnant for the past two years. I'm glad to start using and taking care of my body again. I do _highly_ prefer exercising in the form of a game like volleyball, pickleball, or racquetball instead of just running.

My dad hosts a simple single elimination football pool every year. Each week, you pick one team to win and you can only pick each team once. I've been playing for as long as I can remember but never make it past week four or five. This year, I made it a whopping 12 weeks. I made a risky pick and **lost my last spot in the pool** so maybe I'll win next year. Damn Steelers.

Finally, I left to **visit Austin, Texas** on Sunday to see some friends from Peace Corps. The stars aligned and all of us were in the area so AM and I hopped on a bus to go hang out in Austin. It was so much fun. We just got back so that's why these weeknotes are a few days late. More shenanigans from the trip to come next week.

- [How I build things](https://herman.bearblog.dev/how-i-build-things/) by Herman Martinus. I like Martinus' framework here. Follow inklings, let them stew if they need it, tinker with ideas that personally fulfill you, then focus on the ones that resonate with others.
- [Wind the clock](https://www.citationneeded.news/wind-the-clock/) by Molly White. I'm a bit late to the party but I finally got around to reading this one. It's about the election results but I really like the actionable section at the end where White lists things you can do to support the causes you want to support.
- [The Deep Sea](https://neal.fun/deep-sea/) by Neal Agarwal. The ocean is mind-bogglingly deep. It's wild that life can survive without light and under unfathomable pressure.
- [If someone's having to read your docs, it's not "simple"](https://justsimply.dev/) by General Products. A great way to make your writing clearer and nice. Simply remove words like "easy," "painless," "simple," "just," and the like.
