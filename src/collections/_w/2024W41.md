I spend _a lot_ of time on the internet and on my computer. I'm not ashamed—I really love it here.

## Added a table of contents and some posts to my website

Lots of website additions this week. First, I started with a table of contents on posts that I specify! Having a table of contents is great because:

- You can quickly jump to certain parts of a page. Usually when I'm looking at my own website, I usually know roughly where I wrote something down and I can find stuff much faster with a TOC.
- It lets readers know quickly what they are getting into. [Subheadings should tell the story](https://gilest.org/clarity-hacks.html) by themselves so the TOC is a really quick overview of what the post is about.

This has been on the todo list for a while but there wasn't an easy way to do it how I wanted with my <%= link_to "static site generator of choice.", "collections/_p/rebuilt-with-bridgetown.md", class: "internal-link" %> It can automatically generate a TOC but it would have to be _part of_ the article and I wanted it to be _next to_ the article. So, I did some HTML magic. When my website builds, it loops through all of the posts and does the following:

1. Checks for `toc: true` in the post front matter. If false skip else continue.
2. Inject a marker into the post that tells the generator to automatically create a TOC.
3. After the page is rendered, pull out the TOC HTML from the article HTML.

After that it's just styling to make it look nice. I wanted the TOC to always be a touch away so on large screens, it stays stuck right next to the article after scrolling. It's colored in a lower contrast color than the article so that it doesn't distract from the article. On small screens, the TOC is hidden and only shown when a button is pressed. The button stays stuck to the upper left-hand corner so it's out of the way but available when needed. It's colored in a _higher_ contrast here because it is visually on top of the article.

I had to write some stuff so people could see my hard TOC work. One post was about <%= link_to "teaching and learning in a second language", "collections/_peace-corps/if-you-can-read-this.md", class: "internal-link" %> and what that ultimately means for access to information. That was a pretty fun one to write. It was a submission in [this month's IndieWeb carnival](https://tilde.team/~zinricky/multilingualism/) about multilingualism on a global web. I never thought I'd ever be multilingual but here I am writing about it.

The other post was <%= link_to "an update", "collections/_p/introducing-heyjohn-forum.md", class: "internal-link" %> to an online community I started a while back for my friends. The <%= link_to "original vision", "collections/_p/heyjohn.md", class: "internal-link" %> of creating a small, private, highly-interconnected online community free of ads, algorithms, and performativity didn't change but the actual platform did. In short, I'm now running a small forum.

## Started a forum

You can read the <%= link_to "full post", "collections/_p/introducing-heyjohn-forum.md", class: "internal-link" %> for details but after spending time in a really friendly one, I decided forums are the best platform for communities. I replaced my community's Mastodon instance with a forum. I thought the "speed" of Mastodon and microblogging would be perfect but Mastodon's goals are different than mine. They're trying to do social media right, connecting everybody to everybody else. I wanted a private community where there's a _small group_ of people connected to each other.

With that small of a group size, I think the space and intentionality of a forum are more appropriate. So, I shut down the Mastodon server and fired up a server running [NodeBB.](https://nodebb.org/) Modern forum software is really slick these days. I chose NodeBB because it is more fully featured than [Flarum](https://flarum.org/) but lighter and snappier than [Discourse.](https://discourse.org/)

The forum itself is running at [um.heyjohn.social](https://um.heyjohn.social) so the base domain was free. I quickly made a [landing page](https://heyjohn.social) that looks like a legal pad and I love it.

## Bits and Bobs

- Discovered **em dashes—** they are nearly the perfect punctuation. They can replace semicolons, parentheses, and commas. Maybe I've been using them too much but I think they're cool.
- **Solved a treasure hunt** that was hosted by [Suntup Editions](https://suntup.press/news/suntup-editions-treasure-hunt-contest/) and told to me by [foreverliketh.is.](https://foreverliketh.is/) The challenge was to find 16 letters scattered randomly across the website. Once you find them, you unscramble them into a Latin phrase. There will be a write-up after the deadline is finished.
- Added **new fonts** to the website. The base font is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) because it's, um, really legible. The headings are in [Syne](https://gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface) which pairs well (I think) and plays into that neobrutal vibe I'm going for.
- Did research on how to **automate creating Open Graph images** for my website. Most people start up a virtual browser and screenshot the page but that is slow and seems too "brute-force" to me. I think my options are to use [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/ruby-vips) to add text to a base image or somehow run [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) from Ruby. Stay tuned.

Tap away in the little keyboard and put part of your experience of the hour or day or week into words and share it with us.
