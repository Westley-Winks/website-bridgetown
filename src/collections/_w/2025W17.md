I started the week with a **game of golf** at a relatively small golf course in the area. It was nice to get outside, walk the course, and hang out with my friends. We only had three people so we couldn't do teams where I usually rely on my teammate to save my bad shots.

I continued the **job search**. I finally found a couple that I am excited about and mostly qualified for so I sent in some applications.

We dropped into the local bookstore and **picked up a _signed_ version of Everything Is Tuberculosis** by John Green. I didn't have the money to pre-order and get a signed version but they were having a deal that day and I had to have it. It fits nicely right next to my signed The Anthropocene Reviewed.

For the weekend, I went to my small hometown and **had drinks with some family members**. I pulled out the weed-eater from its slumber and tried to **get started on weed control** but the head was worn down and it was feeding out too much string. So, not much got done on that front and I'm waiting for a replacement.

I got sucked into the world of **Stardew Valley**. I've put way too many hours into my farm this week. To make it at least a little bit educational, I switched the language to Spanish. I've learned a lot of new words and phrases for around the house, the farm, and the mines.
