In media this week, I **finished reading The Black Orb by Ewhan Kim**. What a strange and delightful book. Overall, it was pretty good that had themes of misinformation, mob mentality, and despair. I so badly wanted to know more about the orbs themselves but maybe the point is to not know. If the orbs represent despair, can we ever truly understand it—where it comes from, why it exists, and what to do when it surrounds you from all sides?

I've had **Disco Elysium** on my list of games to play for a while now and it finally came on sale so I picked it up. Incredible game that is quickly becoming one of my favorites. It's a role-playing game that lets you make decisions and the story evolves from there. On my first run, I died of a heart attack in minutes but the second run is going much better. The art is incredible, the skill system is great, and the voice acting is mesmerizing.

This week's coding creation and learning exercise was a project that **tracks actions completed by the Oregon Legislature** as they happen. Go [check it out](https://olt.wwinks.com/) and share it with the Oregonians in your life. In short, it pulls public data from the legislature and displays it in a timeline for a more informed state. It's got an infinite scroll and a nice clean interface. <%= link_to "Write-up", "collections/_p/olt.md", class: "internal-link" %> coming next week when there's actual activity happening.

This weekend, AM and I **went to the Bend pride festival** and had lots of fun. There was live music, great weather, and a beautiful venue. I bought some new pins and AM got some art.

عيد مبارك عليكم!
