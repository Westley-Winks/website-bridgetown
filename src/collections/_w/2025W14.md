A pretty slow week this week. I went to the library and **picked up Huddud's House** by Fadi Azzam. It sucked me in and I'm almost halfway done with it already.

I **continued the job search** this week as well. The job pool for engineers in Eugene/Springfield/Corvallis is pretty small but I sent out some résumés and emails. Hopefully something will stick.

Continuing down the learning Elixir path, I **did some exercises on Exercism** and found it to be a really great platform. It's well-designed and I like the community aspects of it.

The sun came out this weekend and we enjoyed it with **burgers and margaritas** on the porch. Once it started getting dark, we had a fire and talked about everything from the internet age to the economy.
