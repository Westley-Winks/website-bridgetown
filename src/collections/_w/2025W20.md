This week, I **attended some virtual career events** provided by my university for alumni. One was a workshop for how to get a job. I learned some new places to look for jobs and some actionable tactics for how to respond to those openings. I also (re)learned that employers mostly do skill-based hiring these days. Rarely do they look at GPA or where you went to school. They want to know _what_ skills you have and _how_ you apply them. Another event was a networking function for departments in Oregon government. I wanted to be a civil servant working for the government but the federal hiring freeze put a stop to that. But state- and county-level government is worth looking into.

I **added some services and testimonials to a client website** over lunch and a beer. This client's business is gaining traction and he is now eyeing bigger clients so we added some polish to his website.

We **played some pickleball** on a nice morning this week. It was a relatively serious game with higher-level players. I learned a bit and had a ton of fun. I think I'm a pickleball guy now.

One of my best friends is **planning an annual boys backpacking trip** and he sent over some options for where we are going to go. We've been doing this for a few years now but I wasn't able to go the past two. It's always so much fun to get outside and spend quality time with friends. Excited for summer!

To top off the week, we **burned the pile of scrap** in the pasture. It's still burn season and it had rained the previous week so we went out there and had a fire. Good fun.

And now that I'm back and not using WhatsApp as my main communication tool, I'm remembering how awful SMS is. I think we've outgrown it.
