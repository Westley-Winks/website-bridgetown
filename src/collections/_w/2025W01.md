Happy 2025! We made it another year.

To start off the week, I **went bowling.** Scoring 144, I think I broke a personal record. We had fried bowling alley food and a couple pitchers of beer. Good times.

In media, I **watched Amber Alert.** It was quite the thriller. I think it did a good job of showing that for all the horrible people out there, there are lots of others who would do anything to do the right thing. I also watched **To Catch a Killer.** It started off really intriguing but fizzled out in the last quarter.

After a long hiatus, I finally got to **play DnD** with a new group. It was a quick one shot with lots of puzzles and traps and a couple of combat engagements. In my last campaign, I played as a fighter and got bored of being the tank who absorbed damage and swung his longsword. This time, I tried playing as a rogue and had a bit more fun with it.

I've been doing a completely [analog](/t/analog/) productivity/task management system for the past couple of years. Before that, I heavily used **Todoist** and loved it. This week, I **tried going back** and setting up a new system. I like everything about it and there are a lot of new features. The only thing that gives me pause is the privacy aspectâ€”I don't want a company knowing everything I do every single day. The productivity gains might be worth it, though. I'll try it out this month and see how it goes.

On New Year's Eve, AM and I **went to her friend's wedding** and had so much fun. It was a beautiful venue, lots of good food, an open bar, and lots of dancing and laughing. I wore a lapel pin that I got in Spain and got a lot of compliments on it which was surprising. I also got to try out my <%= link_to "new Camp Snap camera", "collections/_w/2024W52.md", class: "internal-link" %> and loved how they turned out.

Lastly, I **got a haircut.** After I got back to the states, I tried to be experimental with a mullet after rocking the "Moroccan fade" for two years. But, I ended up hating it after a few weeks and cut it off.

Some of my joys this year were exploring and learning Racket, actually participating in some online communities, and being more "outward" with my writing and website.
