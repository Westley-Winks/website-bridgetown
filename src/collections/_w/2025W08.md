This week, I **launched my [first client website](https://coloradoenergysolutions.com/)**! This is the first time I got paid for doing development work. It took a few weeks and I learned so much about how to work with others and what my process will look like moving forward. On the technical side, I started from a public domain template built with 11ty and vanilla CSS. From there, I implemented features and elements the clients wanted, went through a few rounds of revisions, and shipped it. They were really happy with it and are excited to get their new business moving with a fresh new home on the internet.

I also **started another client website** using what I just learned from the last project. This time, I'm using Astro and Tailwind to optimize for speed and quality-of-life improvements for me. Things like optimizing images took a bunch of time in the last project and Astro does a lot of that stuff without me really thinking about it. I used Tailwind a long time ago but opted to really dig into vanilla CSS since then. I like the speed, I do not like how messy it makes the HTML.

I **switched from Todoist to [Tweek](https://tweek.so/) for my task management**. I really took advantage of all of Todoist's features (and their student discount) during college and just got back into it a few months ago. There is _a lot_ going on there that I don't need. Tweek is ultra-simple and really good-looking. It's a simple weekly layout with tasks under each day and that's about it. You can create custom lists (e.g. Someday), use colors to differentiate tasks, and set reminders as well. It has just enough features without bogging me down and it also fits nicely into my <%= link_to "weekly review process", "collections/_p/weekly-review.md", class: "internal-link" %>. Excellent find, thanks to [ner3y](https://ner3y.me/bye-todoist-hello-tweek/).

For fun, we **celebrated AM's birthday** by going out for cocktails and charcuterie. It was a quirky little venue with great drinks and friends. After that, we went to a dive bar for some cheaper beers and called it a night.
