      - [Which Year](https://whichyr.com/) daily challenge. Fun game that shows you five photos from history and you guess which year it came from. The closer you guess, the more points you get.
      - [Rush Hour](https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/) by Michael Fogleman. A classic game with nothing added.
      - [Hyperwood](https://hyperwood.org/) by Johannes J. Schmidt. This is an interesting project. It's an early, open-source system for creating furniture with wooden slats. It's not _very_ actionable yet but the idea is really cool.
      - [Fix It, Then Pass It On: iFixit Joins Forces with Back Market](https://www.ifixit.com/News/109306/fix-it-then-pass-it-on-ifixit-joins-forces-with-back-market) by Elizabeth Chamberlain. This is a great partnership. Browsing Back Market, there's some great devices for _way_ cheaper than new at the same quality. Definitely going here first when (if) I need new stuff.
      - [You Don't Have to Learn Everything Today](https://yordi.me/you-dont-have-to-learn-everything-today/) by Yordi Verkroost. Learning new things seems easy until you learn enough to know what you don't know. It's an exciting thing, to me.
      - [This page is a truly naked, brutalist html quine.](https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html) by Leon Bambrick. This is a cool way to "break the rules" and "make the internal external." It looks brutal while still looking really nice.
      - [Illuminati Hotties: Tiny Desk Concert](https://youtu.be/WGH5zZLsixk) by NPR. Yes, I watched this at least five times.
      - [No Web Without Women](https://nowebwithoutwomen.com/) by Selman Design. Showcases technological advances done by women over the course of history.
      - [Lessons From the Staj](https://eraebarnes.com/2025/02/10/lessons-from-the-staj/) by Emilie Barnes. Emilie is a good friend and we were in the same Peace Corps cohort together. We also ran the multimedia committee together with one other volunteer. This piece nicely puts into words how I feel about all of my new friends I met in Morocco.
      	> The diversity of America is one of its greatest, and often overlooked, strengths.

<section class="card about">
  <h2 class="card__title">Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by committing to these core values, even when it's uncomfortable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning humbly.</strong> Pursuing and practicing new skills and knowledge that serve my goals, my interests, and other people. Doing it humbly means embracing a beginner's mindset, admitting when I am wrong or don't know, and understanding that I can always learn something from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving compassionately and reliably.</strong> Helping others, supporting them and nurturing their growth when and how <em>they</em> need it. Doing it compassionately means leading with empathy, taking care of myself, and remaining other-focused rather than transactional. Being reliable is continually building trust with myself and others that I will do what I say I'm going to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connecting authentically.</strong> Investing in meaningful relationships while participating in and adding value to important things that are larger than myself. Being authentic means choosing truth over performance, not sacrificing my values or identity to fit in, and being my true self in any engagement with myself or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
