      - [HTML For People](https://htmlforpeople.com/) by Blake Watson. Anybody can make a website and this beautifully designed web book goes from "never coded before" to having your own. Everyone should have their own corner of the internet and this guide makes it accessible.
      - [how to buy shoes in the fediverse](https://www.wrecka.ge/fediverse-shoes/) by Erin Kissane. Why it's hard to find a home server on the fediverse. Server governance isn't one-size-fits-all and they don't all work for everyone.
      - [Typing Bowl.](https://typingbowl.com/) Race players by typing faster than them.
      - [The Static Site Paradox](https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/) by Loris Cro. Static sites are faster, safer, and simpler. But making a dynamic one full of junk is much easier to make with a website builder. This leads to over-engineered websites that are way too complex for most people.
      - [A peasant woodland](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/peasant-woodland) by Mandy Brown. Thoughts on why and how writers look for readers.
      	> We write because something needs to be expressed through us, and only by giving the writing to a reader is that need fulfilled.

      	> This is perhaps the greatest conundrum of our current technological era: the desperate need to connect with one another, because it is our only hope of survival; combined with the fact that nearly all the means of connection available to us are deeply—possibly irredeemably—fucked.
      - [I love your week notes and day notes and art and lists](https://anniemueller.com/posts/i-love-your-week-notes-and-day-notes-and-art-and-lists) by Annie Mueller. Even when you think you are boring or have nothing to contribute, **share anyways.**
      	> I like your daily meandering thoughts. I like you describing your routine. I like hearing about the things outside of your routine, too. Did you go to the doctor’s? How did it go? Did you have an unexpected visitor? How was that for you? I’m interested. Tell us what’s on your mind. Tap away in the little keyboard and put part of your experience of the hour or day or week into words and share it with us.
      - [Write as you wish: a call to bring back the prose](https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/Write_as_you_wish:_a_call_to_bring_back_the_prose) by Marisabel Munoz and [Prose, circumlocution and cantinfleadas](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/2024-10-09-prose-circumlocution-and-cantinfleadas/) by Joel Chrono. Interesting thoughts on writing more verbose _when it's necessary._ There is a time and a place for brevity and both the audience and the topic determine how you should communicate.
      - [Metric-Less Success](https://moretothat.com/metric-less-success/) by Lawrence Yeo at More to That. Important things in life that are the *real* goalposts usually can't be measured by an external number. Treating people with compassion can't be measured. Living with integrity can't be put into a number.
      - [anh's home page.](https://anhvn.com/) Beautifully and expertly crafted and kind of creepy. Incredible.
      - [How I Experience the Web Today](https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/) by Guangyi Li. A satirical look at modern websites and their god awful popups, modals, ads, and paywalls.

<section class="card about">
  <h2 class="card__title">Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by committing to these core values, even when it's uncomfortable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning humbly.</strong> Pursuing and practicing new skills and knowledge that serve my goals, my interests, and other people. Doing it humbly means embracing a beginner's mindset, admitting when I am wrong or don't know, and understanding that I can always learn something from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving compassionately and reliably.</strong> Helping others, supporting them and nurturing their growth when and how <em>they</em> need it. Doing it compassionately means leading with empathy, taking care of myself, and remaining other-focused rather than transactional. Being reliable is continually building trust with myself and others that I will do what I say I'm going to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connecting authentically.</strong> Investing in meaningful relationships while participating in and adding value to important things that are larger than myself. Being authentic means choosing truth over performance, not sacrificing my values or identity to fit in, and being my true self in any engagement with myself or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
