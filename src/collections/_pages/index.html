      - [Joaquin: A Youth Development volunteer in Morocco](https://wanderingtheworld.com/joaquin-a-youth-development-volunteer-in-morocco/) by Jim Damico and Joaquin Ross-Tellechea. My friend Joaquin who I served with did an interview sharing things he did and learned in Morocco.
      - [Is speaking multiple languages overrated?](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/11/12/multiple-languages-overrated/) by Scott H. Young. While being able to speak multiple languages _sounds_ cool, it usually isn't worth it unless you are traveling. It's better to stick to getting really good at one local language.
      - [This must be the place](https://newpublic.substack.com/p/this-must-be-the-place) by Josh Kramer. Building local communities and using technology to facilitate that. We have a responsibility to build things now for the billions who will live after us.
      - [The Off Set font set](https://off-type.com/products/offset) by Off Type. Really good deal on some beautiful and fun fonts. Added to my Christmas list.
      - [D-20 wristwatch](https://timestoptech.com/products/d-20-black-resin) by Timestop. I actually just lost my trusty Casio calculator watch I've had for years in airport security. This one looks just retro-cool but it can generate random numbers.
      - [One-page RPG Jam submissions](https://itch.io/jam/one-page-rpg-jam-2024/entries) on itch.io. Lots of really cool indie RPG games with rules that fit on one page. My friend and I tried Handful of Spies and it was pretty fun once we got the hang of it.
      - [Generate YouTube RSS feeds](https://ytrss.pesky.moe/) by Pesky. Put in a YouTube channel and get its RSS feed in return.
      - [I was such an asshole](https://themustardsandwich.substack.com/p/21-i-was-such-an-asshole) by Swati Singh. We're all assholes at one point or another and the hard part is learning from it.
      - [How I build things](https://herman.bearblog.dev/how-i-build-things/) by Herman Martinus. I like Martinus' framework here. Follow inklings, let them stew if they need it, tinker with ideas that personally fulfill you, then focus on the ones that resonate with others.
      - [The Deep Sea](https://neal.fun/deep-sea/) by Neal Agarwal. The ocean is mind-bogglingly deep. It's wild that life can survive without light and under unfathomable pressure.
      - [If someone's having to read your docs, it's not "simple"](https://justsimply.dev/) by General Products. A great way to make your writing clearer and nice. Simply remove words like "easy," "painless," "simple," "just," and the like.

<section class="card about">
  <h2 class="card__title">Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by committing to these core values, even when it's uncomfortable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning humbly.</strong> Pursuing and practicing new skills and knowledge that serve my goals, my interests, and other people. Doing it humbly means embracing a beginner's mindset, admitting when I am wrong or don't know, and understanding that I can always learn something from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving compassionately and reliably.</strong> Helping others, supporting them and nurturing their growth when and how <em>they</em> need it. Doing it compassionately means leading with empathy, taking care of myself, and remaining other-focused rather than transactional. Being reliable is continually building trust with myself and others that I will do what I say I'm going to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connecting authentically.</strong> Investing in meaningful relationships while participating in and adding value to important things that are larger than myself. Being authentic means choosing truth over performance, not sacrificing my values or identity to fit in, and being my true self in any engagement with myself or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
