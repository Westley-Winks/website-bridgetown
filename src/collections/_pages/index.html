      - [The skill of allyship](https://recipesforwellbeing.substack.com/p/the-skill-of-allyship) by Recipes For Wellbeing.
      	> Allyship is not about saviourism or paternalism. Rather, it’s about using your privilege to open doors, to challenge discriminatory policies and practices, and to advocate for systemic change. It’s about being willing to **take risks, face backlash, and leverage your social and political capital for justice.**
      - [Know how you'll end your presentation](https://gilest.org/end.html) by Giles Turnbull. Don't fizzle out of a presentation with "and, um, yeah that's pretty much it." Let your audience know, clearly, when your presentation has ended. I just finished reading Turnbull's book and I've been enjoying reading around his website for more communication nuggets.
      - [Modern apologies](https://seths.blog/2024/09/modern-apologies/) by Seth Godin.
      	> “Sorry” doesn’t have to be an admission of guilt or acceptance of fault. It could simply be the kind way one human acknowledges to another human that things aren’t ideal right now.
      - [What Came First?](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/what-came-first/ZQGBUPErEE3bVg) by Google Arts & Culture. Fun game which made it very clear that I don't know very much about history or culture. It gives you two cultural artifacts and you decide which came first. After you choose, you get a little snippet of info for each one which is a nice way to learn.
      - [All on the table](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/all-on-the-table/) by Mandy Brown at everything changes. I love everything Brown writes and this was no exception.
      	> "It is a fundamentally different experience to negotiate an exchange of funds with a living, breathing, person versus with a mindless, unconscious organization. It’s more vulnerable and personal, and there’s more on the table than just cash."
      - [Your brain is biased by default. Here's how to reset it. \| David Eagleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L9UHONpSfM) by Big Think. People don't experience reality in the same way. We can expand our worldviews and internal models by traveling and interacting with others. Understanding our biases towards people in out-groups is a good way to counteract them.

  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by
      living according to my core values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning.</strong> I live for the pursuit of learning and it
        gives my life meaning and purpose. I stay curious and am always looking
        for new information and skills. For me, learning looks like <%= link_to 'reading books', 'collections/_pages/b.md' %>, <%= link_to 'coding', 'https://github.com/Westley-Winks' %>, solving
        puzzles, reading blog posts, <%= link_to 'writing', 'collections/_pages/p.md' %>, and
        trying new things. One of my weaknesses is learning <em>for the sake of learning</em> and staying on the
        theoretical side of things instead of applying them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Service to others.</strong> One of my roles in this life is to
        compassionately serve others, supporting them and nurturing their growth.
        I enjoy being known as &quot;the guy&quot; who people call, knowing that
        I will put all my effort into helping them. Serving others looks like
        <%= link_to 'volunteering', 'collections/_pages/peace-corps.md' %>, choosing the "support role"
        in any game I play, and <%= link_to 'writing', 'collections/_pages/p.md' %>.
        
      </li>
    </ul>
