      - [TikTok Shutdown — Why Building on Proprietary Platforms is a Risky Game](https://bouia.com/blog/technology/tiktok-shutdown-why-building-on-proprietary-platforms-is-a-risky-game/) by Ilias.
      	> Building anything of value around a proprietary platform is very risky. Whether it’s a software application, a brand, or anything that you can categorize as a major revenue source, should be owned and hosted by yourself. Platforms that you have no control over can disappear overnight, or change in ways that would make it impossible to continue using them in ways you’ve anticipated.
      - [Dark Patterns Detective](https://games.productartistry.com/games/dark-patterns) by Rohan Dehal. Great little game that shows you common dark patterns. It's good for both consumers _and_ designers to be aware of these things that are commonplace techniques on today's internet.
      - [TabBoo](https://tabboo.xyz/) by Brian Moore and Justin. A browser extension that gives you random jumpscares on sites that you choose to prevent endless scrolling. Fantastic idea!
      - [The Three Types of Writing](https://moretothat.com/the-three-types-of-writing/) by Lawrence Yeo at More To That. The three kinds of writing live on a spectrum between introspection and expression. Writing to release is introspective (e.g. journaling, morning pages). Writing to present is expressive and used to share your ideas with others (e.g. stories, blog posts, videos). Writing to think is right in the middle. It forces you to organize your thoughts while still being experimental.
      - [You should have a website](https://nora.zone/manifesto.html) by Nora Reed. Own your digital life with resiliency by having your own website that isn't at the whim of who is in office or big tech companies.
      - [Hacking Subaru: Tracking and Controlling Cars via the STARLINK Admin Panel](https://samcurry.net/hacking-subaru) by Sam Curry. A vulnerability in Subaru's admin network allowed people to track any Subaru. This made me really value my old 2002 Forester that isn't connected to the internet.

<section class="card about">
  <h2 class="card__title">Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by committing to these core values, even when it's uncomfortable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning humbly.</strong> Pursuing and practicing new skills and knowledge that serve my goals, my interests, and other people. Doing it humbly means embracing a beginner's mindset, admitting when I am wrong or don't know, and understanding that I can always learn something from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving compassionately and reliably.</strong> Helping others, supporting them and nurturing their growth when and how <em>they</em> need it. Doing it compassionately means leading with empathy, taking care of myself, and remaining other-focused rather than transactional. Being reliable is continually building trust with myself and others that I will do what I say I'm going to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connecting authentically.</strong> Investing in meaningful relationships while participating in and adding value to important things that are larger than myself. Being authentic means choosing truth over performance, not sacrificing my values or identity to fit in, and being my true self in any engagement with myself or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
