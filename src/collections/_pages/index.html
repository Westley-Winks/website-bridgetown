      - [On feeling connected](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/giving) by Henrik Karlsson. Karlsson describes giving as "an act of potency." I've been thinking about better language for "serving" or "giving" that doesn't sound so zero-sum. When I do things for others, it gives me life and meaning—positive sum. I don't quite know how to convey that succinctly yet. "Potency" is _close_ but not quite right.
      - [Emily McDowell on Reclaiming Creativity, Navigating Burnout, and Finding Balance](https://www.goodworkshow.com/emily-mcdowell-on-reclaiming-creativity-navigating-burnout-and-finding-balance/) on the Good Work podcast. I love when Brooks gets vulnerable and goes back and forth with the guest. He talked about approaching uncertainties with an "open-handed posture" and I really needed to hear that. I need to trust myself to respond to things with integrity. I completely trust Present Me yet it's so hard to do the same with Future Me.
      - [Nature's many attempts to evolve a Nostr](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/natures-many-attempts-to-evolve-a) by Gordon Brander. Walks through different network architectures from traditional centralized ones to federation to peer-to-peer to Relay—a fundamentally different one being explored by Nostr. Users own their keys (like peer-to-peer) while still being able to scale (like centralized servers).
      - [Can you run the UK economy?](https://ig.ft.com/chancellor-game/) by the Financial Times. You're the chancellor and you need to create a fiscal plan that doesn't tank the economy. Citizens did not particularly like my tax plan.
      - [Math Encrypt](https://scientific.place/math-encrypt/) by k4rim. Turns any positive integer into a math equation.
      - [Alt text selfies](https://alttextselfies.net/welcome/) by Olivia, Bojana, and Finnegan. A collection of self-portrait descriptions using text. Reading how people describe themselves makes me smile.
      - [Haves and choices](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/haves-and-choices/) by Mandy Brown at everything changes. On the difference in mindset between saying you "have to" versus saying that you "choose to."
      - [HTML For People](https://htmlforpeople.com/) by Blake Watson. Anybody can make a website and this beautifully designed web book goes from "never coded before" to having your own. Everyone should have their own corner of the internet and this guide makes it accessible.
      - [how to buy shoes in the fediverse](https://www.wrecka.ge/fediverse-shoes/) by Erin Kissane. Why it's hard to find a home server on the fediverse. Server governance isn't one-size-fits-all and they don't all work for everyone.

<section class="card about">
  <h2 class="card__title">Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by committing to these core values, even when it's uncomfortable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning humbly.</strong> Pursuing and practicing new skills and knowledge that serve my goals, my interests, and other people. Doing it humbly means embracing a beginner's mindset, admitting when I am wrong or don't know, and understanding that I can always learn something from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving compassionately and reliably.</strong> Helping others, supporting them and nurturing their growth when and how <em>they</em> need it. Doing it compassionately means leading with empathy, taking care of myself, and remaining other-focused rather than transactional. Being reliable is continually building trust with myself and others that I will do what I say I'm going to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connecting authentically.</strong> Investing in meaningful relationships while participating in and adding value to important things that are larger than myself. Being authentic means choosing truth over performance, not sacrificing my values or identity to fit in, and being my true self in any engagement with myself or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
