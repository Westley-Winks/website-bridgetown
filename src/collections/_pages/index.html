      - [Web page annoyances that I don't inflict on you here](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/01/04/cruft/) by rachelbythebay. I think the internet would be a much better place if websites didn't do most of the stuff listed here.
      - [Ten things in tech I found joy in during 2024](https://rubenerd.com/ten-it-things-i-found-joy-in-this-year/) by Ruben Schade. There's lots of negative talk in the tech world so it was refreshing to read about some good things. Some of my joys this year were exploring and learning Racket, actually participating in some online communities, and being more "outward" with my writing and website.
      - [Portability is optionality](https://buttondown.com/blog/portability-is-optionality) by Justin Duke at Buttondown. Similar to the [file over app idea,](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) choose services that let you export your stuff into a reasonable format.
      - [Media recap 2024](https://anhvn.com/posts/2025/media-recap-2024/) by anh. Incredible designs all over this website from home page to the media recap.
      - [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol/) blogging platform. This looks really cool! Your whole blog is one file that you drag-and-drop in to deploy it to the web. You keep your content and you don't have to mess with figuring out a static site generator.
      - [Bridgetown 2024: Year in Review](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/news/2024-year-in-review/) by Jared White. Excited about Bridgetown developments! I know I'm going against the grain here, not using 11ty and all, but Bridgetown is a lot of fun and I like using Ruby.
      - [A Timeless New Year](https://moretothat.com/a-timeless-new-year/) by Lawrence Yeo at More To That. I prefer making a "new year roadmap" instead of resolutions.
      - [Why I'm skeptical of minimum prices for ride-sharing](https://dynomight.net/prices/) by Dynomight. I love a good economic analysis with a real-world example.
      - [Release 25.01 Highlights](https://helix-editor.com/news/release-25-01-highlights/) by Helix editor. Helix has been my daily driver for a while now and it just keeps getting better. I'm having some trouble installing 25.01 but I'll get that sorted next week.

<section class="card about">
  <h2 class="card__title">Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="card__content">
    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by committing to these core values, even when it's uncomfortable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning humbly.</strong> Pursuing and practicing new skills and knowledge that serve my goals, my interests, and other people. Doing it humbly means embracing a beginner's mindset, admitting when I am wrong or don't know, and understanding that I can always learn something from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving compassionately and reliably.</strong> Helping others, supporting them and nurturing their growth when and how <em>they</em> need it. Doing it compassionately means leading with empathy, taking care of myself, and remaining other-focused rather than transactional. Being reliable is continually building trust with myself and others that I will do what I say I'm going to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connecting authentically.</strong> Investing in meaningful relationships while participating in and adding value to important things that are larger than myself. Being authentic means choosing truth over performance, not sacrificing my values or identity to fit in, and being my true self in any engagement with myself or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
