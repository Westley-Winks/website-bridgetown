      - [How to Live By Your Values This
      Year](https://every.to/no-small-plans/how-to-identify-and-live-your-life-by-your-values) by Casey Rosengren and a
      hat tip to Sasha Chapin's [I was not acting like me, are you acting like
      you?](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/i-was-not-acting-like-me-are-you). Good articles about values and how we
      live (or don't live) in alignment with them.
        - I really liked the idea of a value being a `verb + adverb`. A verb is actionable and an adverb defines how you
      do that verb. For example, instead of having "wisdom" as a value, it could be changed to "learning humbly."
        - I added a prompt to my daily journal entry: "What is one behavior from today that connects to your values?"
      - [Graphs World](https://www.graphs.world/). A daily puzzle that shows you some graph and you have to select the
      dataset that fits the graph. The graphs aren't very colorblind friendly but still fun.
      - [The Moral Implications of Being a Moderately Successful Computer Scientist and a
      Woman](https://www.sigops.org/2024/the-moral-implications-of-being-a-moderately-successful-computer-scientist-and-a-woman/)
      by Irene Y. Zhang. It's easy to hand-wave the existence of sexism away by saying "yeah, yeah, I would never
      discriminate against a woman, I treat men and women equally, etc." It's important to remember the unconscious bias
      and moral fallacies men hold towards women, especially in STEM fields.
      [Entitled](http://www.katemanne.net/entitled.html) by Kate Mann has been added to my reading list.
      > For example, my very *existence* as a moderately young, moderately successful computer scientist threatens some
      men’s sense of identity, thus making them uncomfortable and/or lash out. But if a successful woman in computer
      science makes men in our community uncomfortable, then we are not likely to have too many successful women in the
      community.

    <p>
      My name is Westley Winks. I try to live my life with integrity by
      living according to my core values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning.</strong> I live for the pursuit of learning and it
        gives my life meaning and purpose. I stay curious and am always looking
        for new information and skills. For me, learning looks like <%= link_to 'reading books', 'collections/_pages/b.md' %>, <%= link_to 'coding', 'https://github.com/Westley-Winks' %>, solving
        puzzles, reading blog posts, <%= link_to 'writing', 'collections/_pages/p.md' %>, and
        trying new things. One of my weaknesses is learning <em>for the sake of learning</em> and staying on the
        theoretical side of things instead of applying them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Service to others.</strong> One of my roles in this life is to
        compassionately serve others, supporting them and nurturing their growth.
        I enjoy being known as &quot;the guy&quot; who people call, knowing that
        I will put all my effort into helping them. Serving others looks like
        <%= link_to 'volunteering', 'collections/_pages/peace-corps.md' %>, choosing the "support role"
        in any game I play, and <%= link_to 'writing', 'collections/_pages/p.md' %>.
        
      </li>
    </ul>
