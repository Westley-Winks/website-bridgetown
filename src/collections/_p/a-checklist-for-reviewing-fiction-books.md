title: A Checklist for Reviewing (Fiction) Books
toc: true

Though it comes in waves, I think I [read more](/b/) than the average person. I read non-fiction during the day when my brain is fully operational about topics I'm currently interested in. At night or when I just want a break, I open up my fiction book.

I recognize that fiction is supposed to be exactly that—a break. Like a movie, you turn it on to get transported into other lives and worlds. But a great lingering effect of watching popular shows and movies is that you get to talk about it with friends. Rarely does that happen with books.

I like to enjoy books then think a little bit harder about them and savor them at the same time. Since it's rare that someone else I know is reading the same book, the best way I know how to do that is to [write about it](/t/fiction/). It's not nearly the same as a book club but it does do a good job of organizing my thoughts about what I just read.

I have a series of prompts that I ask myself when reviewing a book that works as a guide to make sure I think about all the possible elements that make books worthwhile. This is my checklist, a tweaked version of the [CAWPILE review system](https://bookriot.com/the-cawpile-review-system/), with some explanation of each part.

Firstly, I usually have to remind myself here that [book notes and reviews don't have to be long](https://briefbookreviews.blog/) to be enjoyable. I _don't need to sound smart_ or "bookish" to anyone. Like most writing, it's better to post something than nothing and it's easy to get stuck in the weeds trying to force something out when I don't actually have an opinion.[^1]

## Set the scene

- [ ] **Context.** Where did you hear about this book? Did someone recommend it to you? What made you want to read it?

I don't like writing summaries anymore. Generally, Goodreads and Wikipedia do a much better job than I ever could in that department. Instead, I add context by sharing why I wanted to read the book or where I heard about it.

## Determine if you enjoyed it or not overall

- [ ] **Enjoyment.** Did you like the book? Would you recommend it to others? Was it a page-turner or a slog? Were you thinking about the book while you weren't reading it? Were you engaged? Did you stay up too late reading it?

Really, I'm trying to answer the usual "how did you like it?" question that gets asked when you mention or recommend a book to someone. In a few sentences, I quickly get to the point and decide if it was worth the read or not.

- [ ] Write a **plot summary** in a few short sentences. What was the book about?

Okay, maybe I do write summaries. This isn't in the actual post but it does show up in the description when [viewing all of my books](/b/). I try and limit this to three sentences. Again, people generally ask "what is it about?" and this is a really fast answer to that.

## Note your favorite quotes

- [ ] Were there any funny, thought-provoking, or interesting **quotes**? Write them down one after another.

I read primarily on my Kindle and I highlight quotes and phrases that make me laugh or think. When I finish, I run a scrappy Python script that moves those highlights to a file in my note-taking system. Then, I slap them in blockquotes and put them right at the top here.

## Dig into specifics to answer why you did or didn't enjoy it

Now we get into the actual meat of the book. At the beginning, I write whether I enjoyed the book or not. This section answers why. Each of these is a prompt for specific elements. If there was nothing of note in a particular category, skip it. The order is deliberate—it starts at a high level, gets more specific, and becomes meta. This is also where I usually put in a spoiler alert.

- [ ] **Plot.** Was the concept, main theme, or main conflict interesting? Did you learn something? Was the ending beautiful or a disappointment?
- [ ] **Tone/Atmosphere.** How did you feel while reading the book? Were you on the edge of your seat or was it calming? Could you read this before bed or did you need a little more energy to match the book? What was the general emotion that you felt?
- [ ] **Worldbuilding.** Was the world interesting? Was it vivid or dull? Could you visualize the setting? Is the culture different from your own and is it interesting or plausible?
- [ ] **Characters.** Were there any notable or interesting characters? What did you like or dislike about them? Were you rooting for them? Were they relatable and authentic? How about interesting relationships between the characters?
- [ ] **Writing style.** Did the author write in a unique way? Is the dialogue awkward? Was it too "Hollywood"? Did you have to look up a lot of words? Did the author write a character that they obviously have no idea how to write?
- [ ] **Logic.** Were there any plot holes or loose ends? Did everything make sense? Did any characters do something they wouldn't do? Did you ever stop and ask _why would they do that?_

## Separate notable scenes, themes, or elements

- [ ] Is there a specific part of the book that you want to **talk about more**? A specific theme or scene that you want to explore further or question?

For example, there was one part of <%= link_to "The Lies of Locke Lamora", "collections/_b/lies-of-locke-lamora.md", class: "internal-link" %> that irked me so much that it needed its own paragraph. Overarching themes or other stuff like that goes here.

## Finish with a conclusion

- [ ] Add in a **short blurb to end**. Might be the same as the "summary" tagline. Could be "I recommend everyone read this book." Could be an interesting quote to end on.

Maybe the most difficult part, I like to tie up the post with _something_ at the end. Usually a recommendation or quip.

[^1]: It's also why I have a big list of books that I've read but haven't written notes for.
